# Introduction:

This project aim to create a timer to stand up/stand down while you are working at your desk.
It should be useful for your back, thank me later ;)

# Instructions:

1. Please rename example's config as `config`, the script won't work without it!
2. You can change the sleep times (stand up and standown times) and the notification's sounds
3. Have fun!

# NOTE:

- You need the program Sox to play the notification's sound
