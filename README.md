# Introduction:

This project aim to create a timer to stand up/stand down while you are working at your desk.
It should be useful for your back, thank me later ;)

It is essentialy a bash script.

# Instructions:

1. Please rename `example.config` file as `config`, the script won't work without it!
2. You can change:
   - the sleep times (stand up and standown times)
   - Notification's sounds
   - The language that you want to use as the description of the notification
   
   **PROTIP** Edit the language.json dictionary to add more languages and after that edit the config file with the new title of the language.
3. Have fun!

# NOTE:

- You need the program Sox to play the notification's sound
- You need the program Jq to parse the language Json dictionary
